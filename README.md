- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Forms**: React Hook Form, Zod
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Lucide React icons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database
- Environment variables configured

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd PGC_Jobs_Platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and configure:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Random secret for NextAuth (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

4. Set up the database:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

(`migrate dev` applies migrations in `prisma/migrations`. For a blank database only, that creates all tables. Use `npx prisma db push` only if you intentionally bypass migrations.)

5. (Optional) Seed the database with an admin user:
```bash
# You can create an admin user manually through the database or API
```

6. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Database Schema

The platform uses Prisma with PostgreSQL. Key models include:
- User (unified authentication)
- JobSeekerProfile, CompanyProfile, OrganizationProfile
- Experience, Education, Competency, Reference, Language
- Subscription, Payment
- JobPost, Application
- ContractOffer, Contact
- Advertisement, ActivityLog

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate Prisma Client
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema to database
- `npm run db:migrate` - Create/apply migrations in development (`prisma migrate dev`)
- `npm run render:migrate` - Apply migrations in production (`prisma migrate deploy`; on Render free tier, migrations also run in the **build** command — see `render.yaml`)
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio

### Creating an Admin User

Admin users can be created manually in the database by setting `userType` to `ADMIN` for a user account.

## Subscription Packages

### Direct Package - $10/year
- Full profile showcase
- Direct contact with employers
- Priority in search results
- Access to all job postings
- Full profile details visible

### In-Direct Package - $5+/year (minimum)
- Limited profile showcase
- Contact through Prinstine Group
- Basic profile details visible
- Access to selected job postings
- Privacy protection

## Deployment

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (e.g., Supabase, Railway, or your own server)
2. Configure environment variables in your hosting platform
3. Run database migrations
4. Build and deploy the Next.js application

Recommended hosting platforms:
- **Render** – See [RENDER.md](./RENDER.md), [RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](./RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md), and [render.yaml](./render.yaml). On the **free** web tier, migrations run during **build** (no pre-deploy hook). Create an admin once with `npm run create-admin:prod` in the web service Shell (set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your `https://…onrender.com` URL).
- **Vercel** – See [VERCEL_FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT.md](./VERCEL_FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT.md).
- Railway
- AWS
- DigitalOcean

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs
- Authentication handled by NextAuth.js
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Input validation on API routes
- SQL injection protection via Prisma
